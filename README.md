# Guess the Animal Game

This is a simple command line implementation of a game where the user guesses the name of an animal by answering questions about the animal's characteristics, written in Python. The program uses a decision tree to guide the user towards the correct answer.

## Usage

To use the program, users must first clone the repository and navigate to the appropriate directory. Then, the program can be run from the command line by using the following command:

## Copy code

```
python3 guess_the_animal.py
```

This will start the game and prompt the user with a series of questions about the animal's characteristics, such as its habitat, diet, and physical features. The user can select one of the options or type "I don't know" if they are not sure. The program will then use the user's answers to guide them towards the correct answer.

## Gameplay

The game will continue to ask questions until the user correctly guesses the animal. The program will keep track of the number of questions asked and display it once the user guesses the correct animal.

## Note

This program is intended for entertainment and educational purposes only. It is designed to be a simple and fun way to learn and practice basic programming concepts such as decision trees, loops, conditionals, and user input.

## Requirements

Python 3.x
